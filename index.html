    <div id="title1">150 years ago, Long Marsh Island, off the coast of Queen Anne's County, Maryland, boasted X acres of land.</div>
    <div id="title2">A century later, its land had shrunk X percent.</div>
    <div id="title3">By 1992, it was gone.</div>
    <div id="title4">Experts estimate hundreds like it have eroded since the English explored the Chesapeake Bay in the 1600s.</div>
    <div id="title5">And with climate change causing sea levels to rise faster than ever, more islands are in danger of vanishing.</div>

        <p id="title6">These are the lost islands of the Chesapeake.</p>
        <p class="copy">We’re losing land in the Chesapeake Bay. Sea levels in the Chesapeake have risen a foot in the last century, more than twice the past global average. In Maryland and Virginia, that water isn’t just encroaching on coastline; it’s swallowing islands whole.</p>
        <p class="copy">The natural erosion that the area experiences began accelerating in the 1850s &mdash; the same time the Industrial Revolution massively increased our output of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, said Kristin Reilly, communications director for the National Wildlife Federation.</p>
        <p class="copy">Since then, upward of 500 islands have sunk under the waters of the bay. Some are only specks on old maps or lines in early documents dating to the English settlers, and with holes in the historical record, it’s hard to know just how many we’ve lost, Reilly said. Most islands have never housed people, but they have served an essential role in the bay’s ecosystem, where they provide habitats for waterfowl and birds, for example.</p>
        <p class="copy">Using historical shoreline surveys collected by the Maryland Geological Survey, we can track the disappearance of some of those islands.</p>
